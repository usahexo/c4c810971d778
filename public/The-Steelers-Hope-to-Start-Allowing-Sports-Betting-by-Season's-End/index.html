            <h1 id="The-Steelers-Hope-to-Start-Allowing-Sports-Betting-by-Season’s-End"><a href="#The-Steelers-Hope-to-Start-Allowing-Sports-Betting-by-Season’s-End" class="headerlink" title="The Steelers Hope to Start Allowing Sports Betting by Season’s End"></a>The Steelers Hope to Start Allowing Sports Betting by Season’s End</h1><p>The Steelers hope to start allowing sports betting by the end of the season, as they are one of the few states without any legal sports betting options. Currently, there are only six states that allow some form of legalized sports betting: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. Pennsylvania is looking to join this list, with lawmakers indicating that there is enough support to legalize sports betting before the end of the year.</p>
<p>If legalized, the state would join a growing market for sports betting. A study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming found that if all 50 states allowed sports betting, it could grow to a $7 billion industry. The main drivers for this growth would be mobile wagering and an increase in people using their phones to bet on sporting events. It’s not just NFL games that would be affected either - people would be able to bet on college games, horse races, and other sporting events.</p>
<p>There are concerns about what this will mean for the integrity of the sport, but supporters argue that it can be regulated effectively. There have been instances where people have tried to fix games, but these tend to be rare. In most cases, the fix is attempted when there is a lot of money on the line and it’s not something that can be easily done without being caught.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few months. If Pennsylvania does legalize sports betting by the end of the year, it will join a small group of states that offer this type of gambling option.</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-Owner-Speaks-out-in-Favor-of-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Steelers-Owner-Speaks-out-in-Favor-of-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Steelers Owner Speaks out in Favor of Sports Betting"></a>Steelers Owner Speaks out in Favor of Sports Betting</h1><p>Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II has spoken out in favor of sports betting, saying that it would be a “positive development” for the NFL. He added that the league is in a “good position” to take advantage of any changes in the law that would allow for legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Rooney’s remarks come at a time when the NFL is facing increasing pressure to legalize sports betting. Sports leagues have long been opposed to sports betting, fearing that it would lead to game-fixing and other forms of cheating. However, that opposition is starting to change, as leagues see the potential for huge profits from legalized gambling.</p>
<p>The NFL has agreed to partner with MGM Resorts International, one of the largest casino operators in the world. The two companies will work together to create and market new types of interactive gaming products that will be available to fans worldwide.</p>
<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has also spoken out in favor of legalized sports betting, saying that it would be “a mistake” to ignore its potential benefits. He noted that the league has taken steps to ensure the integrity of its games, and that any legalized sports betting would need to include strong safeguards against cheating.</p>
<p>Goodell also pointed out that many people already bet on NFL games illegally, so it makes sense to legalize and regulate the activity. This would allow the league to collect taxes on wagers and also provide some security against fraud.</p>
<p>The recent Supreme Court ruling legalizing sports betting has created a flurry of interest in the topic. In addition to the NFL, other leagues like Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) are also looking into ways to capitalize on the new opportunities created by legalization.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is in favor of legalizing sports betting. Some lawmakers and religious groups argue that it is a form of gambling that can lead people into addiction and financial ruin. They also argue that it exploits poor people who can least afford it.</p>
<p>So far, only a few states have actually legalized sports betting, but more are expected to do so in the coming years. It remains to be seen how this will play out for professional sports leagues, but it seems likely that they will benefit greatly from this growing industry.</p>
<h1 id="Pittsburgh-Mayor-Backs-Proposed-Legislation-to-Allow-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Pittsburgh-Mayor-Backs-Proposed-Legislation-to-Allow-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Pittsburgh Mayor Backs Proposed Legislation to Allow Sports Betting"></a>Pittsburgh Mayor Backs Proposed Legislation to Allow Sports Betting</h1><p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has expressed his support for proposed Pennsylvania state legislation that would allow sports betting in the city. The measure, which is currently making its way through the state Senate, would specifically authorize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise, as Peduto has previously voiced his support for legalizing sports betting in order to generate additional revenue for the city. In a statement released earlier this week, he said, “This legislation is about working together to create jobs and grow our economy – something that we can all get behind. I encourage all of my colleagues in the legislature to pass this important bill.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh stands to benefit significantly from legalized sports betting. Not only would the city gain revenue from taxes on gambling winnings, but it could also see an increase in tourism and job growth as a result of the new industry. Casino operators are already expressing interest in opening up shop in Pittsburgh should the legislation pass, and many believe that the city could become a major player in the sports betting market.</p>
<p>There is significant opposition to the proposed legislation, however, with some arguing that it would lead to increased addiction and other social ills. Others maintain that it is simply a ploy by casino operators to lure gamblers into their establishments. Nevertheless, with Mayor Peduto’s backing it appears likely that the legislation will eventually be passed into law.</p>
<h1 id="GAO-Says-States-Lose-Billions-a-Year-in-Uncollected-Tax-Revenue-from-Sports-Betting"><a href="#GAO-Says-States-Lose-Billions-a-Year-in-Uncollected-Tax-Revenue-from-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="GAO Says States Lose Billions a Year in Uncollected Tax Revenue from Sports Betting"></a>GAO Says States Lose Billions a Year in Uncollected Tax Revenue from Sports Betting</h1><p>A report released today by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that states lose billions of dollars in uncollected tax revenue from sports betting.</p>
<p>The report, which was requested by Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen, found that in 2017, state and local governments lost $16 billion in tax revenue from sports betting. This amounted to $4.7 billion in federal taxes and $11.3 billion in state and local taxes.</p>
<p>“This report confirms what we have long suspected: that states are missing out on billions of dollars in revenue each year due to the illegal sports betting market,” said Warren. “It’s time to bring this multi-billion dollar industry out of the shadows and into the light, where it can be properly regulated and taxed.”</p>
<p>Van Hollen added, “This report makes clear that it is past time for Congress to take action and pass legislation allowing states to legalize and regulate sports betting. This would provide a new stream of revenue for our states while also protecting consumers and preserving the integrity of sporting events.”</p>
<p>Currently, sports betting is only legal in a handful of states, including Nevada. In most other states, it is illegal but takes place anyway through bookmakers or offshore websites.</p>
<p>The GAO report recommends that Congress take action to allow states to legalize and regulate sports betting. This would allow state and local governments to collect taxes on bets placed within their borders. It would also help protect consumers and ensure the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Pennsylvania-Is-One-of-the-Last-States-to-Authorize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Pennsylvania-Is-One-of-the-Last-States-to-Authorize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Is One of the Last States to Authorize Sports Betting"></a>Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Is One of the Last States to Authorize Sports Betting</h1><p>Pennsylvania became the fourth state to authorize sports betting on Monday, October 1st. The decision came just in time for football season, as sports fans will now be able to place bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>The state legislature passed a bill in June that would allow for sports betting, but it was not signed into law until Governor Tom Wolf approved it earlier this month. The bill allows for both online and in-person sports betting, and casinos in the state are expected to offer it starting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the last states to legalize sports betting, as New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi all passed bills earlier this year. Sports betting is already legal in Nevada and Oregon.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will bring in much-needed revenue to the state. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board estimates that the industry could generate up to $100 million in taxes each year.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills. However, supporters note that there are measures in place to help protect consumers, including a ban on wagering on college games played in the state.</p>
