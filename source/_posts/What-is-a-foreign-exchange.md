#  What is a foreign exchange?

A foreign exchange, also known as FX or forex, refers to the global market where currencies are traded. It is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with average daily volumes exceeding $5 trillion.

FX traders buy and sell currencies with the aim of making a profit. They do this by taking advantage of price differences between different currencies. For example, they may sell euros in order to buy US dollars.

The FX market is incredibly diverse, with participants coming from a range of backgrounds. These include banks, hedge funds, central banks, retail brokers, and individual investors.

# What drives FX prices?

The main drivers of FX prices are economic fundamentals. These include factors such as interest rates, inflation, economic growth, and geopolitical risk.

When it comes to interest rates, for example, an announcement by a central bank that it is hiking rates will typically lead to a strengthening of the currency involved. This is because higher interest rates make that currency more attractive to investors.

Inflation is another important factor when it comes to FX prices. A high level of inflation can erode the value of a currency over time, while low inflation can lead to appreciation.

# How do we trade FX?

There are two ways to trade FX: spot and forward contracts.
Spot contracts allow traders to buy and sell currencies immediately at the current market rate. Forward contracts, on the other hand, allow traders to lock in an exchange rate for a future transaction. This can be useful if you are expecting the currency to appreciate or depreciate in value in the future.

#  What is a foreign exchange rate?

A foreign exchange rate (FX rate), forex rate, or FX/currency pair is the exchange rate between two currencies, deriving from the value of the two currencies. The foreign exchange market is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. The foreign exchange market determines the relative values of different currencies.

The foreign exchange market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week. Currencies are traded worldwide in the major financial centers of London, New York, Tokyo, Zürich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Singapore.

The most commonly traded currency pairs are called "major" currency pairs and are traded against the U.S. dollar (USD). Other popular pairs include the euro (EUR), British pound sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), Canadian dollar (CAD), and Australian dollar (AUD). 

In finance, an exchange rate (also known as a foreign-exchange rate, forex rate, FX rate or Agio) between two currencies is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another. It is also regarded as the value of one country's currency in relation to another currency.[2] For example, an interbank exchange rate of 119 Japanese yen to the United States dollar means that ¥119 will be exchanged for each US$1 or that US$1 will be exchanged for ¥119. In this case it is said that the yen has been quoted against the dollar.[3]

The spot exchange rate refers to the current exchange rate.[4] The forward exchange rate refers to an agreement to exchange money at a fixed date in the future.

#  What is a foreign exchange market?

The foreign exchange market (Forex) is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. The Forex market is made up of banks, commercial companies, central banks, investment management firms, hedge funds, and retail traders.

The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions and operates on several levels. It is organized into dealing rooms, which are either local or international. 
There are three tiers in the Forex market: interbank, brokerages, and retail. Interbank refers to the group of large global banks that transact with each other frequently. Brokerages are the next tier down and consist of smaller banks and other financial institutions that offer services to retail investors. Retail investors are individuals and families that invest through a brokerage.

The Forex market is open 24 hours a day from 5 p.m. EST on Sunday until 4 p.m. EST on Friday because there is always a currency being traded somewhere in the world. 

The most popular currencies traded in the Forex market are the U.S. dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), British pound sterling (GBP), Swiss franc (CHF), Canadian dollar (CAD), Australian dollar (AUD), and New Zealand dollar (NZD).

#  What is a major currency pair?

A major currency pair is when two currencies are traded against each other and is one of the most commonly traded pairs in the Forex market. The major currency pairs include: USD/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and AUD/USD.

The first currency listed is known as the base currency while the second currency is known as the quote currency. In order to calculate how much one unit of the base currency is worth in terms of the quote currency, you would use the following formula: (base currency x exchange rate) / (quote currency).

For example, if you wanted to know how many Japanese yen (JPY) you would get for one United States dollar (USD), you would use the following formula: (1 USD x 109.05 JPY) / (109.05 JPY). This would give you a result of 0.009206JPY, meaning that for every dollar you have, you could exchange it for 9.206 Japanese yen.
