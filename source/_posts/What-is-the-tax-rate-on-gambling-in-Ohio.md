#  Is there a tax refund available for gambling losses in Ohio?

Like many other states, Ohio has a gambling losses tax deduction available for taxpayers. If you itemize your deductions on your federal income tax return, you are able to deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. This includes losses from casino gambling, poker tournaments, race track betting, and lotteries.

In order to claim the deduction, you must have gambling records showing the amount of your winnings and losses. These records can be in the form of statements from the casino or other gambling establishments, tickets or other written evidence of winnings and losses, or even a diary detailing each instance of gambling and the associated outcome.

Keep in mind that not all gambling activities are considered qualified for the deduction. For example, wagers placed with friends or family members are not deductible, and any money that is used to purchase food or drinks at a casino is also not deductible.

If you have any questions about whether or not your specific gambling activities qualify for the tax deduction, be sure to speak with a tax professional.
