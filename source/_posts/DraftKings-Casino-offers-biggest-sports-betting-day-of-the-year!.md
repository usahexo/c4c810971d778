In what is dubbed as the "biggest sports betting day of the year," DraftKings Casino is set to offer some of the most lucrative bets for its customers. The online casino has released its schedule of events, which will include matchups from the National Football League (NFL) and English Premier League (EPL).

The NFL's Super Bowl LI is scheduled for Sunday, February 5, 2017, and will be the focus of many bettors. In addition to the usual pre-game and in-game betting options, DraftKings Casino is offering a variety of prop bets for the big game. Some of these include whether Tom Brady or Matt Ryan will have more passing yards, whether there will be a safety, and how long Lady Gaga's halftime show will be.

For those looking to make some serious money on Super Bowl LI, DraftKings Casino has a special contest with a $1 million prize pool. The contest consists of picking 10 different props for the big game, with the highest scoring participant taking home the top prize.

While the Super Bowl is always a major event when it comes to sports betting, don't forget about other matchups taking place that day. The EPL's Chelsea vs. Arsenal match is scheduled for Saturday, February 4th at 12:30pm EST and offers plenty of opportunities for wagering. In addition to traditional match bets, DraftKings Casino offers props such as "Chelsea Win Both Halves" and "Will There Be A Penalty?"

Online casinos are typically a big money maker around the holidays, and DraftKings Casino is no exception. The site has been reporting record traffic and wagers leading up to the final days of 2018, with over $1 billion in bets placed on December 26th alone!

The massive sum breaks the site’s previous daily record by more than $200 million. That’s a lot of action on everything from blackjack to craps to roulette!
