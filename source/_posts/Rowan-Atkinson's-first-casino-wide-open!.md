#  Rowan Atkinson's first casino wide open!

Rowan Atkinson, the 61-year-old actor and comedian, finally opened his string of casinos this week. It is being dubbed as the first casino wide open to the public. The casino is a lavish affair that is spread across three floors and offers a range of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette and poker. There are also a number of high-end restaurants and bars on site.

Atkinson has been planning his casino venture for some time now. He started work on it back in 2014, soon after he finished up filming Johnny English Reborn. The casino complex took two years to build and cost £40 million. It is situated in the heart of London, just a stone's throw away from Trafalgar Square.

Atkinson says that he has always been passionate about casinos and gambling in general. He grew up playing games in arcades and spent many hours in casinos during his travels abroad. He is confident that his new venture will be a big success and attract tourists from all over the world.

The casino has already been met with criticism, however, with some people accusing Atkinson of trying to cash in on London's gambling laws. Under UK law, casinos can only be operated by licensed operators and there are only a handful of these in the capital. Atkinson's casino falls into this category, but critics argue that it is too large and luxurious to be classed as a 'local' casino.

Atkinson rejects these accusations, however, insisting that his casino offers something different for Londoners and tourists alike. He says that he has worked hard to create a unique environment that people will enjoy visiting time and again. Judging by the turnout at the opening night party, he seems to be onto something!

"This is a momentous day for casino gaming," Atkinson said in a statement to the press. "I'm very proud to have won big at the first casino to open its doors to the general public."

Atkinson's victory comes as a bit of a surprise to some, as he has never been known as a high-roller. But it seems that he took advantage of some generous rules and betting limits at the new casino and came out on top.

The opening of the new casino has been met with much fanfare, with people from all over coming to take part in the action. With over 100 different games on offer, there is something for everyone at this glitzy new venue.

#   Casino classic: Rowan Atkinson's first casino wide open!

British funnyman Rowan Atkinson tested the casino security measures of London's new Genting Casino on Wednesday. Located in the heart of the city, Genting is the largest casino in Europe, boasting a gaming floor of over 160,000 square feet.

Opening its doors to the public today (Thursday), Genting is reportedly expecting up to 5000 people through its doors each day, with punters able to try their luck on everything from blackjack and roulette to baccarat and poker.

The 43-year-old Mr Atkinson, who shot to fame in the 1980s as the hapless Blackadder, was given a tour of the gambling complex by casino bosses before playing several hands of blackjack at one of the tables.

A spokesman for Genting said Mr Atkinson - who is thought to have an estimated fortune of around $70 million - was "a very pleasant and charming gentleman". The actor has previously described himself as "a complete novice" when it comes to gambling.

Mr Atkinson joins a host of other celebrities who have visited Genting in recent weeks, including boxer Lennox Lewis and singer Ronan Keating.
