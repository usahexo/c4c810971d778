On a recent trip to the casino, Antonio Del Rio, the six-time World Series of Poker champion, showed some of the players how to win at blackjack. He started by explaining that the goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible while not going over.

Then he offered some tips on how to do just that. Here are three of his top strategies:

1) Play smart and keep track of the cards. This means knowing when to hit and when to stand, and also keeping an eye on what the dealer is showing. If you can anticipate which cards are likely to be drawn next, you can make better decisions about your hand.

Dolores Del Rio was a famous Hollywood actress during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She starred in films such as "Flying Down to Rio" and "The Lady in Question". But what many people don't know is that Del Rio was also an accomplished blackjack player. In fact, she was so successful at blackjack that she taught her technique to other players, who also enjoyed success.

Del Rio's strategy is incredibly simple, but it's also incredibly effective. Here's how it works: 

1. Before playing, find a table that has a low minimum bet. This will allow you to play for longer without losing too much money. 
2. Place a bet of one-fifth of the table minimum on the first hand. If you lose, double your bet on the next hand. If you win, lower your bet to one-fifth of the table minimum for the next hand. 
3. Repeat this process until you either lose or reach the table maximum limit.

This strategy is known as "martingale betting", and it's a common technique used by blackjack players. The basic idea is that you increase your bet size after each loss, in order to recoup your losses and make a profit. And while this strategy can be lucrative in the short term, it can also lead to big losses if you're not careful. That's why it's important to only use this strategy with tables that have a low minimum bet amount.

3. It doesn't require any special skills or knowledge.
