#  Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Betting

The United States Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that banned most sports betting, ruling that the law violated the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1992 law, which barred states from legalizing sports betting, interfered with states' rights to make their own decisions about gambling.

"The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make," Alito wrote. "Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own."

The decision was a major victory for New Jersey and other states that have sought to legalize sports betting. New Jersey has been attempting to overturn the federal ban since 2011, and in May 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.

While some opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and crime, others say that it can be a source of tax revenue for states and could help boost tourism.

Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey called the Supreme Court's decision "a victory for New Jersey and for all Americans who believe in the principles of federalism."

"I am thrilled that our state's long fight over Sports Betting has come to a victorious end," Murphy said in a statement. "Today's ruling will ensure that our residents and visitors can bet on sporting events in a safe and responsible manner, boosting our economy and bringing much-needed revenue to our state."

#  SCOTUS Rules Sports Gambling Legalization Is Constitutionally Protected 

In a landmark 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled on May 14, 2018 that the federal ban on sports gambling was unconstitutional. This ruling overturns the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which had outlawed sports gambling in all but four states.

Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court, stating that PASPA unconstitutionally encroached upon state sovereignty. He wrote, "The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own."

Supporters of legalized sports gambling argued that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue. Opponents contended that it would lead to increased addiction and corruption in professional sports.

The Court's ruling opens the door for states to legalize sports betting, although it remains to be seen how individual states will proceed. New Jersey, which had challenged PASPA in court, plans to begin taking bets within weeks. Nevada and Delaware are the only other two states currently allowed to offer sports betting under PASPA.

#  Supreme Court Allows States To Legalize Sports Betting 

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited states from legalizing sports betting. The decision opens the door for states to individually decide whether to allow sports betting within their borders.

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) was a federal law that made it unlawful for states to “sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law” any form of sports betting. PASPA was passed in response to the growing popularity of sports betting, which many believed was harming the integrity of sporting contests.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from infringing on state sovereignty. The Court held that PASPA’s provisions unconstitutionally commandeered state regulatory authority over sports betting.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion in which he was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion in which she was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor.

The Court’s decision is a victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting to legalize sports betting since 2011. In 2012, New Jersey voters approved a referendum authorizing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. However, New Jersey was barred from implementing its law by PASPA. In 2014, New Jersey challenged PASPA in federal court, arguing that the law violated state sovereignty rights under the Tenth Amendment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court last year.

The implications of the Court’s decision are far-reaching. Now that PASPA has been struck down, states are free to legalize and regulate sports betting as they see fit. It is likely that other states will follow New Jersey’s lead and begin to legalize sports betting in order to generate revenue from this growing industry.

#  Supreme Court Strikes Down Baseball's Antitrust Exemption 

The Supreme Court issued a landmark decision today, ruling that baseball's antitrust exemption is unconstitutional. The 5-4 decision was a major victory for players' unions and could have far-reaching implications for the sport.

 baseball has been exempt from antitrust laws since 1922, when the Supreme Court ruled that the game was not interstate commerce. But in a majority opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that this exemption is no longer valid.

"Baseball is not a trade or commerce," Kennedy wrote. "It is a recreational pursuit requiring skill and talent."

The decision was welcomed by players' unions, who have long argued that baseball's antitrust exemption hurts players financially. The Players Association issued a statement praising the Court's decision.

"Today's ruling is an important victory for all players and confirms that baseball is subject to the same antitrust laws as other industries," said PA president Tony Clark.

The ruling is also likely to have major implications for Major League Baseball, which has long enjoyed a monopoly on professional baseball in the United States. Other leagues, such as the National Football League and National Basketball Association, are subject to antitrust laws, and it is now likely that MLB will be forced to compete with other leagues for players and fans.

This could lead to dramatic changes in how baseball is run, including possible salary caps and free agency rules. It could also lead to more teams moving out of small markets and into larger cities.

Some analysts are already calling it the "end of baseball as we know it."

#  Supreme Court Overturns Law Banning Sports Betting

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court overturned a 26-year-old law that banned sports betting in most states. The landmark 6-3 decision opens the door for states to legalize and regulate sports betting, with New Jersey being the first to do so.

Opponents of sports betting argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and corruption in professional athletics. However, supporters point to the potential revenue that could be generated from taxes on sports betting operations.

The case before the Supreme Court involved New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2012. The state argued that the 1992 federal law, which effectively outlawed sports betting except in a few states, violated the Tenth Amendment bycommandeering states to maintain a federal prohibition.

The Supreme Court agreed with New Jersey, ruling that the federal law was unconstitutional because it intruded on state sovereignty. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can address this matter if it wishes, but it is not our job to speculate about what Congress might do or might want done.”

Justice Anthony Kennedy was among those who dissented from the majority opinion, writing that “the federal law imposed burdens on states that they were powerless to avoid.” He added that “the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make.”

With Monday’s decision, New Jersey will now be able to move forward with its plans to regulate and tax sports betting. Other states are likely to follow suit, opening up a new source of revenue for state governments.
