The area now known as Montgomery was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years prior to European colonization. At contact, these tribes were composed of people from complex cultures with many subdivisions. They included the Alabama, Creek, and Choctaw nations. These peoples were agriculturalists with well-developed societies. They made pottery, wove cloth, built houses and raised crops. During the 1700s, many Native Americans were forced to migrate to other parts of the country due to wars and treaties with settler groups.[4]

In 1716, French colonists established Fort Toulouse at current day Wetumpka, Alabama. The fort served as a trading post for French goods headed upriver into what was then British territory.[5] At least one account claims that explorer Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville stopped at present day Montgomery in 1724 on his journey downriver from Fort Toulouse.[6] Several hundred settlers moved into the area following Mobile's cession to Great Britain after France's defeat in North America in 1763; however settlement was sparse due to frequent Indian attacks.[7][8]

In 1814 Andrew Jackson led American troops across the Tallapoosa River; this event became known as the Battle of Horseshoe Bend which resulted in defeat for Creek Red Sticks who were allied with British forces.[9][10] Afterward many Creek Indians were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River; this event increased white settlement in the area.[7][11] In 1816-1818 Jackson had a plantation on Demopolis Lake near present day data-width="650" /> In 1819 following Mobile's cession back to Spain as part of Anglo-Spanish Treaty of 1819,[12] American settlers pressured Spain into ceding its East Florida territory east of the Apalachicola River including what would become Montgomery County.[13][14][15] As part of this treaty, Spanish Florida's border was extended from Apalachicola River westward to Perdido River thus include what would become Escambia County and Baldwin County in future years.[16][17][18] Fort Massachusetts was constructed on Mount Meigs overlooking Montgomery circa 1821; it served as an outpost during Indian Removal era 1830s when most Native Americans living east of Mississippi were forcibly relocated westward during 1830s Trail of Tears marches.[19][20]
