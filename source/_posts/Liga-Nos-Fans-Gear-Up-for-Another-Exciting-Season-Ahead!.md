#  Liga Nos Fans Gear Up for Another Exciting Season Ahead!

Just a few weeks ago, Liga Nos fans were gearing up for an intense and exciting season of top-level football. Now that the season is already underway, the fans are not disappointed! There have been plenty of exciting games and surprising results so far, leaving the table highly unpredictable.

In the Lisboa derby last weekend, Benfica came out on top with a 3-1 victory over Sporting CP. This was an important game for both teams, as they were both battling it out for second place in the table. Benfica’s win puts them in a good position to challenge Porto for the title this season.

Porto are currently top of the table, thanks to their impressive start to the season. They have won all six of their league games so far, scoring 18 goals and conceding only three. They will be looking to continue this winning streak and make it back-to-back titles for the club.

However, there are several other teams who could also challenge for the title. Among these teams are Braga, who have had a very good start to the season and currently sit in fourth place. They will be looking to build on this and make it into Europe again this year.

Another team to watch out for is Galatasaray. The Turkish side recently signed Portugal internationals Bruno Alves and João Moutinho, which has strengthened their squad considerably. They will be looking to make an impact in Europe this year and go further than they have done in previous campaigns.

With so many teams fighting for the title, this season is sure to be another exciting one for Liga Nos fans!

#  Champions League Losers March on in Liga Nos

Despite their Champions League disappointment, several Liga Nos sides have impressed in Europe's secondary competition.

FC Porto were the first Portuguese side to be knocked out of the Champions League, losing 5-2 on aggregate to Liverpool. They then went on to lose 2-1 to Leipzig in the Europa League, but remain undefeated in the Liga Nos.

Benfica were also eliminated from the Champions League, losing 4-1 on aggregate to Bayern Munich. However, they have bounced back in the Europa League, winning their group and setting up a last-32 tie with Frankfurt. In the Liga Nos, they are currently third, two points behind leaders Sporting CP.

Sporting CP had a mixed Champions League campaign, finishing second in their group before being knocked out by Juventus. However, they remain unbeaten in the Liga Nos and currently lead the table.

In Spain, Atletico Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage. However, they have made a strong start to their Europa League campaign, topping their group and setting up a round of 16 clash with Copenhagen. In La Liga, they are currently second, four points behind Barcelona.

Real Madrid also had a disappointing Champions League campaign, being eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain. However, they have made a strong start to their defence of the La Liga title, winning all five of their matches so far.

#  WhoScored Preview: The Top 5 Players to Watch in Liga Nos

The Portuguese top flight is back, and with it comes some of the country’s most exciting talent. Here we take a look at the five players to watch in Liga Nos this season.

1. João Félix (Benfica)

At just 18 years old, João Félix is already one of the most highly-rated young players in Europe. The Benfica forward has drawn comparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo, and he is expected to be one of the stars of the upcoming Euro 2020 tournament. Félix was sensational for Benfica last season, scoring 15 goals in all competitions, and he will be looking to continue his good form this year.

2. Bruno Fernandes (Sporting CP)

Bruno Fernandes is another player who has been linked with a move to one of Europe’s top clubs. The Sporting CP midfielder has been in excellent form over the past few seasons, and he was named Portuguese Player of the Year for 2018-19. Fernandes is an accomplished set-piece taker and also possesses a deadly finish; he scored 22 goals for Sporting last season.

3. Pizzi (Benfica)

Pizzi has been one of Benfica’s most important players over the past few seasons, and he will be looking to help them win their first league title since 2014 this year. The attacking midfielder scored 16 goals and provided 15 assists last season, making him one of the most dangerous players in Portugal. Pizzi is also a set-piece specialist, and he will be looking to score some crucial goals for Benfica this season.

4. Diego Sousa (Portimonense)

Diego Sousa was one of the standout performers in Liga Nos last season, scoring 21 goals for Portimonense en route to their surprise 4th-place finish. The 31-year-old striker has been in excellent form in recent years, and he will be looking to continue his good run of form this season. Sousa could be key for Portimonense as they look to improve on their impressive showing from last year.

5. Diogo Gonçalves (Benfica)

#  Liga Nos Cup - Semi-Final Previews

The semi-final stage of the Liga Nos Cup is about to get underway, with a pair of intriguing fixtures in prospect.

Benfica will take on Sporting CP in one tie, while Braga face off against FC Porto in the other.

Here we take a closer look at both matches.

### Benfica v Sporting CP

The first semi-final will see Benfica take on their fierce rivals Sporting CP.

Both teams are locked on 54 points at the top of the Liga Nos table, but it is the Eagles who hold the edge courtesy of their superior goal difference.

Sporting CP have been in good form recently, but they will face a tough task against an in-form Benfica side.

The Eagles have lost just one match in their last 17 outings across all competitions and they will be confident of securing passage to the final.

Sporting CP will certainly not go down without a fight, but Benfica are likely to come out on top in this one.

#  Can Anyone Stop FC Porto from Winning the Liga Nos?

Since the launch of the Liga Nos in 2002, FC Porto have been the most dominant side in Portugal. The club has won the championship on six occasions, including the last three seasons. This year, they are once again favourites to lift the trophy, and it is difficult to see who can stop them.

Their biggest rivals, Benfica, have had a mixed season so far. They currently sit in second place in the table, but they are 11 points behind Porto and it is hard to see them closing that gap. The same can be said for Sporting Lisbon, who are in third place and trail Porto by 15 points.

There have been some signs of progress at FC Porto this season. They lost their first game of the campaign against Chaves, but since then they have gone on to win 16 of their 18 subsequent matches. Andres Fernandez has been a key player for them this season, scoring 10 goals and providing 5 assists.

FC Porto are not just winning games; they are also impressing with their attacking play. They have scored 53 goals in 18 games this season, which is more than any other team in the Liga Nos. If they can maintain this level of performance until the end of the season, it is difficult to see anyone stopping them from winning another title.
